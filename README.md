# SRAM Dumper

utility program that extracts the data from your System2x6 SRAM memory into a file, wich can be located on either USB, MMCE SD Card or Dongle. the file is created on the same directory where you put this program.

the program is quite basic, and dumps will be overwritten, so make sure to backup the `sram.bin` between dumps if you plan making more of them
